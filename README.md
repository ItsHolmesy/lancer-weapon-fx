# lancer-weapon-fx
## Weapon visual and sound effects for use primarily with the Lancer TTRPG system on Foundry.
This module requires Sequencer and either the free or patreon version of JB2A.  Sequencer provides a simple and intuitive API for creating cool special effects, and JB2A provides a library of effects for Sequencer to use.

A few macros within the manual effects compendium, not linked to any items, require Warpgate to run.

## Usage

### Automatic

Once installed and activated, weapon FX should "just work" with all attack rolls and most tech attacks.

Lancer Weapon FX will strive to support all first party Massif Press content with out of the box macros that just work. This support may lag significantly behind the release of the content.
For third party content, the Effects Manager should be able to handle all the items used at your table.

### Manual

The Effects Manager located in the module settings allows the user to drag and drop most items into the  manager to start a new item/macro pairing.  You can select a premade macro from LwFX or drag and drop your own macro to the applicable effect to complete the pairing.  You can organize your custom pairings into folders and import/export your configurations.
